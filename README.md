# GAN-Based-Near-Field-Channel-Estimation-for-Extremely-Large-Scale-MIMO-Systems
Source codes of the article: M. Ye, X. Liang, C. Pan, Y. Xu, M. Jiang and C. Li, "GAN-Based Near-Field Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems," in IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 304-316, Mar. 2025. Please cite this paper when using the codes.  
This folder contains codes for channel data generation executed in MATLAB and codes for channel estimation executed in Python.

Channel data generation:  Use the script data_generate12.m from the archive tex8_mat.zip to generate near-field channel data.



Channel estimation: Use main_cGAN83.py to train and test the proposed method based on the GAN variant.
